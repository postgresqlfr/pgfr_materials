## December 2007, New York, NY:  The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the release of version 8.3 of the high-performance object-relational database management system.  This release includes a record number of new and improved features which will greatly enhance PostgreSQL for application designers, database administrators, and users, with more than 280 patches by dozens of PostgreSQL contributors from 18 countries.

"The continued evolution of the open source PostgreSQL database gives users the option of deploying a non-proprietary database, allowing them to save money, improve performance and increase productivity.  PostgreSQL 8.3 is an impressive new release and we encourage customers around the world to explore it," said Rich Green, executive vice president of software at Sun Microsystems.

Version 8.3 provides greater consistency of performance than previous versions, ensuring that every user can depend on the same high performance demonstrated in recent benchmarks for every transaction, whether in peak hours or not, seven days a week, 52 weeks per year.  Major performance enhancements include:

* Heap Organized Tuples (HOT), which eliminate up to 3/4 of the maintenance overhead of frequently updated tables
* Load distributed checkpoints, which decrease checkpoint activity at peak load times
* Automated self-tuning of the background writer

These changes also significantly accelerate transaction processing throughput, between 5% and 30%, depending on the workload.

"PostgreSQL just got smarter," said Bruce Momjian, PostgreSQL Core Team member.

PostgreSQL is the first open source database to implement Synchronized Scan, which greatly reduces I/O for data mining.   The Windows team has enabled Visual C++ compilation of PostgreSQL, improving stability and performance on Windows, as well as accessibility to the project to Windows contributors.  New logging options have been added and the overhead of the statistics collector has been diminished in order to make it easier to monitor your servers.

Of course, this wouldn't be a proper PostgreSQL release without providing lots of new features for application developers, including:

* ANSI-standard SQL/XML support, including XML export
* Text search: our advanced full text search tool, TSearch2, has been merged into the core distribution with better management and new dictionaries and languages
* GSSAPI and SSPI authentication support
* New data types: UUIDs, ENUMs and arrays of composite types

"We process over 18,000 queries per second on over 300GB of user data on our PostgreSQL servers, and those numbers go up every month," said Gavin Roy, CTO of social networking site MyYearbook.com. "We're very exited about HOT, shared buffer scan improvements and integrated tsearch indexing.  Preliminary testing shows that 8.3 will improve our database load profile while decreasing response times.  We're really looking forward to it."

In addition to the many new core features, several new optional components have matured and released 1.0 versions during the 8.3 release cycle.  These include SNMP support, horizontal scalability options such as PL/Proxy, pgPool2, and Bucardo, a graphical debugger for stored procedures, and a scalable connection pooler called pgBouncer.  These add to the rich set of accessories already available.

There are dozens of additional features and improvements in 8.3 which will make PostgreSQL a more powerful database platform. See the press kit for details: http://www.postgresql.org/about/press/presskit83
